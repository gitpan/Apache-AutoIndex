NAME
    Apache::AutoIndex - Perl replacment for mod_autoindex and
    mod_dir Apache module

SYNOPSIS
      PerlModule Apache::Icon
      PerlModule Apache::AutoIndex
      PerlHandler Apache::AutoIndex

DESCRIPTION
    This module can replace completely mod_dir and mod_autoindex
    standard directory handling modules shipped with apache. It can
    currently live right on top of those modules. But it also works
    if they are not even compiled in.

    To start using it on your site right away, simply preload
    Apache::Icon and Apache::AutoIndex either with:

      PerlModule Apache::Icon
      PerlModule Apache::AutoIndex

    in your httpd.conf file or with:

       use Apache::Icon ();
       use Apache::AutoIndex;
     
    in your require.pl file.

    Then it's simply adding PerlHandler Apache::AutoIndex somewhere
    in your httpd.conf but outside any Location/Directory
    containers.

    It uses most (pretty soon it'll be all) of the Configuration
    Directives defined by mod_dir and mod_autoindex.

    Since the documentation about all those directives can be found
    on the apache website at:

     http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_autoindex.html 
     http://www.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_dir.html

    I will only list modification that might have occured in this
    perl version.

SUPPORT
    Please send any questions or comments to the Apache modperl
    mailing list <modperl@apache.org> or to me at
    <gozer@ectoplasm.dyndns.com>

NOTES
    This code was made possible by :

    *   Doug MacEachern <dougm@pobox.com> Creator of Apache::Icon, and
        of course, mod_perl.

    *   Rob McCool who produced the final mod_autoindex.c I copied,
        hrm.., well, translated to perl.

    *   The mod_perl mailing-list at <modperl@apache.org> for all your
        mod_perl related problems.
